For this first project I need to develop three key components:
1. A logger that tracks all activity as lines of tex. Each command and the result of each command must be logged, as well as the start and exit of the driver.
2. An encryption program that handles encrypting and decrypting an argument using a Vigenere cipher
    The cipher requires:
        1. Plaintext argument
        2. A key
    Each letter of the argument is encoded with a different Caesar cipher, with the increment being determined by the key (each letter's position in the alphabet is the shift amount applied to the plaintext argument)
3. A driver program, which accepts the name of the log file, and creates two new processes, executing the logger and the encryption program. It will also display a commands menu to the user.

I am planning to get the logger operational first. I'm not worried about getting the commands in the driver operational for awhile, I simply want to ensure that each argument provided in the driver is being kept track of in a separate file by the logger. Later on, I can work on the command logic, and finally implement the Vigenere cipher logic.

I am rusty on pipes so I will need to brush up on using read and write to communicate over pipes, as this project will be completed in C++, which necessitates the read and write commands.

I realized that in order to see that the logger is functional, the driver needs to communicate with it first, so I need to focus on getting the processes set up properly in the driver.

My plan for this session is to set up a parent and child process, allow a user input to be read through a pipe, and then output some messages stating whether or not it was successful.

I am still trying to get the core functionality of the driver down. I want the user to input the name of the logger file and have that be read through a pipe. I have some basic logic for this down, but it is currently causing a segmentation fault. I will need to refine this next session, and then I can move on to actually sending some arguments to the external logger.

I am encountering difficulty implementing my driver.cpp program. I was struggling with understanding how the driver could communicate with a separate logger and encryption program via pipes, but upon looking at the process files provided with this project, I realized I could dedicate one pipe p1 to represent the driver-encryption pipeline, and pipe p2 to represent the encryption-logger pipeline.

I am going to push the provided process files (cpu.cpp and mem.cpp) to this project and determine a way to incorporate the cpu and memory logic into my driver program... It shouldn't be too difficult now that I have a better grasp of how communication over pipes works.

I have copied over the cpu logic to the driver program, and have commented out my prior logic. I have established three pipes, and have created forks and established the child process for the encryption program. The child process for the logger has now been established in a near-identical fashion. I suspect that I may need to rearrange the order of the close and dup2 calls, but I will see how it goes in the testing stage.

I accomplished a lot during this session, and I implemented some of the core logic for the driver program (communication with the encryption and logger programs, and forking to create new processes). I established three pipes and I believe I have a clear idea of how each of them communicate between programs. For the next session, I plan to finish the driver program and test how it actually communicates between files. To do this, I need to establish the driver process. I plan to open/close the respective pipes and implement the menu program (in some form) using a while loop. I also need to create the logger.cpp and encryption.cpp files.

The project is coming along well. I am curious if I will need more or less pipes, or if the ordering of closing a pipe and dup2 matters. I may need to rearrange some lines of code to get this operational.

For this session, I need to finish most of the logic for the driver program. I want to make sure it communicates with the encryption and logger programs. I will most likely implement the logger logic first, upon finishing up the driver, as per my original plan.

I got part of the driver working. It creates the 3 pipes properly (I had an error where I was piping p2 twice, which I corrected to pipe p2 then p3), and also collects the logger filename and the command from the user.

In the past session, I implemented a lot of logic for the driver program. For this session, however, I really need to ensure that the driver is properly sending information over to the logger and encryption programs. I might add some bare bones code to the encryption program to track whether itâ€™s sending data to the logger.

I changed all of the cin >> to getlines, to be entirely consistent. I still need to implement error handling for every case, but I want to ensure that the program works with correct input before I worry about anything else. I realized that, although the menu is working, the program exits after a single "encrypt" command... this is likely because I implemented nothing in my encryption.cpp file, so nothing is written to the pipe, causing the program to exit. Although driver.cpp and logger.cpp are not totally complete, I am going to start adding some functionality to encryption.cpp to see if I can get the communication working.

I have implemented a stub for the encryption program. I implemented a basic menu and the whitespace parser logic. I still have to pass the passkey/arguments through cout and also implement the actual encryption logic for the argument.

I had to change course a little bit compared to a few sessions ago (need to implement the encryption program sooner than expected) but I think the program is coming along nicely.

I'm doing some testing as to whether the processes communicate via cerr or cout. I might need to use cerr to transmit information to the log. I'm still a little bit confused about that but I think I can figure it out by the end of this session. Cout = communication to driver and Cerr = communication to logger? Keeping two separate input streams keeps everything cleaner...

I added an encryption and decryption method to the encryption program. The encrypter adds the string argument and the passkey at the current index, then mods them by 26 (since the alphabet has 26 characters). The decryption program does the same, but in reverse (and uses subtraction instead of addition).

I've discovered a deadlock in my driver program. I added a filestream to handle p2 reads.

Also, in the encryption program, I added an additional modulo within the passkey character array so that, if the passkey is shorter in length than the argument string, the passkey repeats itself.

The biggest hurdle I've overcome so far while testing my program is definitely the compilation. I was only compiling the driver.cpp file, and had forgotten to compile encryption.cpp and logger.cpp by themselves... When I was running ./driver, there were no ./encryption or ./logger accessible so the program kept exiting after each command. After compiling each program, I was able to test and run the program. I need to clean up all of my programs, finish error handling for all cases, and also implement the decryption logic in the driver. I also need to check the case for string inputs. Apart from this, my program is nearly complete.
